  "body": "### Java Tower Defense Game.\r\nThis is a simple tower defense game that I used to learn about GUI programming in Java using awt and swing, sprite sheets, pathfinding, collision detection, explore multithreading, event driven programming, and the MVC design pattern. It is a basic game that includes 1 type of tower and 1 type of enemy but can be extended to include more. The game is played by placing towers along a path that will attack enemies when they come in range. Every enemy that reaches the base will damage it and if too many get through the defenses, the game ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Technologies Used\r\nThe game is written using the Java standard library, the animations were created using inkscape, the audio assets were purchased through an online audio asset provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nJason Boyer\r\n<a href=\"www.jasonrboyer.com\">Author's Website</a>\r\n\r\n###Multimedia\r\n\r\n[Video Demo](https://github.com/dtow1/TowerDefense/blob/master/websiteres/Tower%20Defense%20Game%20Demo.mov)\r\n\r\n",
